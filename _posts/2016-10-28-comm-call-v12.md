In order to facilitate a transformation towards open and reproducible research, rOpenSci is building and improving not only the technical infrastructure, but the social infrastructure as well. To support this, occasionally a Community Call will focus on a topic that reflects the values of rOpenSci. The first of these, on Thursday, December 15th, 8-9 AM PST, will be on "How do I create a code of conduct for my event/lab/codebase?".
