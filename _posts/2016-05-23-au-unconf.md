We delivered the first Australian rOpenSci Unconference in sunny Brisbane on April 21 & 22, 2016. The [Microsoft Innovation Centre](https://www.microsoftinnovationcenters.com/) hosted us with style, and the event unfolded without a hiccup. As an organiser it far exceeded my expectations.

We attracted a stella cohort of participants, collegiality was high, and the event was steeped in learning and making. From the launch BBQ sponsored by [AACo](https://www.aaco.com.au/)  (thank you for the most delicious wagyu steak I have ever eaten), it was awesome being around a group of like-minded individuals passionate about open science.   

The format of the Unconference was a breath of fresh air for the majority of us who were new to the rOpenSci unconf format.  A welcome relief in amongst the forest of academic conferences. I myself am converted! 

Some great outcomes emerged from the Australian open science brains trust attending the event, including: 

   >[Eechidna](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/eechidna) is a package for easily creating visual mashups of Australian electoral and demographic data. Arriving just in time for the lead up to the Australia election (July 2). In the next few days we will launch a visualisation competition around the package.
>
   >[A collection of vignettes](https://github.com/saundersk1/auunconf16) for pulling Australian weather data into R.
>  
   >[Leafier](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/leafier), is an impressive proof of concept for enhancing the performance of large spatial datasets in leaflet.
>   
   >[Snowball](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/snowball), a framework for    adminstering AWS clusters and scheduling cluster jobs from within R.
>
   >[BURGr](http://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Users-of-R-Group-BURGr/), the Brisbane Users of R Group was born out of the conference and will be launched in the next few weeks. 

The event wasn't without it's challenges though. I walked away with a few more feathers in my cap for working with people from different backgrounds and of different personalities to me. As one of the more novice users of R,  my, 'I'm way out of my depth' neon lit forehead tattoo, was in full view as I publicly tried to get my head around what to push, what to pull and if I was really ready to commit to git.  I'm not sure if I have even learned that much in such a short time frame. Thankfully, people where respectful of my 'newbie' vulnerabilities, and - despite the fact I felt like a bit of an impostor -  I can't wait for the next one!   
   
   
Thank you to my amazing collaborators Nick Tierney & Miles McBain, and a special thanks to rOpenSci for your guidance and support.
