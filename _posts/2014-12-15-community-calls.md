We're excited to announce rOpenSci community calls. Key to the success of rOpenSci is our community. We want to hear more from our community, and facilitate interactions among community members. In addition, community calls are a way for us to give important updates, and get feedback on them. 

We tentatively plan on doing community calls once per month. 

We're undecided about the appropriate format for rOpenSci community calls. We could have community members show off software they've been working on, or users demo use cases perhaps. Or do more discussion type calls. For this first call, we'll be doing a combination of demonstration and discussion. We'll refine our approach through time, and hopefully land on something that works swell.  

For our first community call, we'll be joined by Ciera Martinez, who will tell us about the recent NESCENT reproducbility teaching materials meeting. The event was hackathon for teaching materials for reproducible science! We'll use screenshare so they can not only describe but show off the tools they've built (given that the internets are all working that day). 

The 1st meeting agenda:

1. Recent rOpenSci developments - We'll go over noteable developments in rOpenSci software and community.
2. rOpenSci hackathon in San Francisco - We'll be having our 2nd annual US hackathon at GitHub HQ.
3. NESCENT rrhack - Ciera Martinez - Ciera will present highlights from the rrhack event.
4. Q/A session - This will be an open Q/A session, where anyone can ask about all things rOpenSci, either on software, community, etc.

Details:

* Date/time: 2 pm PST (5 pm EST) (10 pm London) (7 am Japan)
* How to join the call: They'll be a number to call, we'll post details soon...
* Collaborative note pad: We'll use Etherpad. You can fine the Etherpad for this call at [https://ropensci.etherpad.mozilla.org/5](https://ropensci.etherpad.mozilla.org/5).

Afer each call, we'll archive the notes, and they'll be publicly available.
