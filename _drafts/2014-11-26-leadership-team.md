rOpenSci began in summer 2011 as a side project when Carl, Scott, and Karthik were still postdocs. Over the years we have grown considerably both in terms of the software tools we provide but also the extent of our reach and the size of our community. The day to day administration of the project has thus far been handled by a loosely formed "core team", a group comprised of the project founders and other invited members. Moving forward, it has become clear to us that we need more formal governance and also have to pave the way for an active board where our community members, financial partners and other stakeholders have an voice in determining the future of the project.

To that extent, we are excited to announce the creation of a new leadership team comprised of the project founders and two new members appointed from our community. The leadership team will meet regularly throughout the year to determine project directions, funding priorities, partnerships, and new initiatives. The team will also be responsible to begin the groundwork to write by-laws that will get us closer to the goal of having an elected board in the future.

To help us with this process, we are delighted to welcome [Jenny Bryan](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/) and [Rich FitzJohn](http://richfitz.github.io/) to the team. Jenny is an Associate Professor at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, appointed in Statistics and the Michael Smith Labs. She's a biostatistician specialized in genomics and an enthusiastic teacher of data science through graduate courses like [STAT 545](http://stat545-ubc.github.io), [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) and the [Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops](http://bioinformatics.ca). Rich is a computational biologist at Macquarie University, Sydney (Australia). He is interested in understanding causes and correlates of diversity across the tree of life, and tries to practice reproducible science.  Jenny and Rich will join us for an initial period of at least a year during which time we hope the new by-laws will help us figure out the plan going forward.

We would also like to use this opportunity to express our gratitude to Ted Hart for serving on the core team (precursor to the leadership team) for the past two years. In addition to contributing to several packages in our suite, Ted also helped run workshops at the Ecological Society meetings at at Science Online. Ted will continue to contribute to rOpenSci packages.

With the new leadership team, the continued growth of our community, software offerings, and our new [NumFocus partnership](http://ropensci.org/blog/2014/10/01/numfocus-partnership/), we are excited about continuing to facilitate open science.
